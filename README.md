# PythonInterpreter

Thought this was a cool project I made.

When running the program, it takes simple python script inputs and ouputs the expected result from a python interpreter.

Make sure to place the 'user_globals.txt' file in the same directory as the 'pythonInterpreter.py' file and open it in an automatic updating software like notepadd++. Once done, variables made in the python interpreter will save in that file and will be able to viewed with the type of variable as well.

Feel free to fork my code and raise issues. I would love some suggestions on how to improve it.
